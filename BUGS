List of known bugs and limitations:

  - The syntax of synge is _very_ flexible. Since Synge doesn't use ASTs, there are no real rules about whether "+ 2 3" or "2 3 +" should work.

List of "bugs" which are not to be fixed:

  - Putting two variables together doesn't multiply them (x=2; y=3; xy isn't 6)
