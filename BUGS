List of known bugs and limitations:

  - Signing has the highest precedence. For example, `-3^2` gives 9 not -9 (which would be expected by people from a mathematical background) while `1-3^2` gives you -8. This is inconsistent.
  - `0-3` becomes `-3` implicitly. This can lead to strange and inconsistent results.

List of "bugs" which are not to be fixed:

  - Putting two variables together doesn't multiply them (x=2; y=3; xy isn't 6)
  - Random numbers are different between operating systems (this is due to differences in the standard libraries)
