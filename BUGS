List of known bugs and limitations:

  - When using the backup variable list, the copying and use of the numbers cause warnings in valgrind

List of "bugs" which are not to be fixed:

  - Putting two variables together doesn't multiply them (x=2; y=3; xy isn't 6)
  - Random numbers are different between operating systems (this is due to differences in the standard libraries)
